    - I've added a component select to do the job

- Unit tests
    - I've added tests to all the componenets and libs! Yay!!
    - Please run `yarn run test`

## Tasks

- Please add tests using your preferred testing tool (jest, mocha, should.js ...)

## Objectives

- You have received a working example so please do not upgrade any packages unless you really have to.
- Please check for small things like syntax errors, since details matter.
